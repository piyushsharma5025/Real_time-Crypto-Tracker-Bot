Real-Time Cryptocurrency Prices:

The bot fetches real-time prices of cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and others from a crypto API (such as CoinGecko or CoinMarketCap).
It can convert these prices to Indian Rupees (INR) or other currencies, allowing users to get the value of cryptocurrencies in their preferred currency.
The bot uses commands such as !price to display the current price of a specified cryptocurrency.
